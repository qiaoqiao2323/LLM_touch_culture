# 🤖🧠 LLM-Generated Culturally Adaptive Affective Touch Behaviours

This repository contains the prompt and structure used to generate **emotion-specific tactile behaviours** using **large language models (LLMs)**—GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o—across different cultural contexts. The aim is to explore how LLMs can simulate culturally sensitive affective touch for human–robot interaction.

## 📄 Overview

Touch is a powerful and nuanced form of social communication, but it is also highly culture-dependent. This project investigates whether LLMs can generate **culturally and socially appropriate tactile behaviours** for expressing emotions through touch.

We focus on:
- 12 **target emotions**
- 3 **cultural contexts**: Chinese 🇨🇳, Belgian 🇧🇪, and Culturally Unspecified 🌍
- 2 **interaction directions**: Human-to-Robot and Robot-to-Human

Each prompt asks the LLM to describe **10 distinct tactile behaviours** to express a given emotion, tailored to a specific cultural context and interaction role.
